<p>OVERVIEW</p>
<p>Is it possible to predict the number of starts a user will give to a product based on the content of his review? Am I able to find different customer behaviours based on different products?</p>
<p>To be able to answer these questions will give me a better perspective of how customer client departments work on E-Commerce companies and do text mining to extract insights from it.</p>
<p><br />
DATASET</p>
<p>I am going to use the data set <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/grikomsn/amazon-cell-phones-reviews">Amazone Cell Phone Reviews</a> from Kaggle website.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[…] this dataset focuses on both unlocked and locked carriers, and scoped on ten brands: ASUS, Apple, Google, HUAWEI, Motorola, Nokia, OnePlus, Samsung, Sony, and Xiaomi.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
TECHNOLOGIES</p>
<p><strong>R</strong> as a programming language. Libraries used:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Data manipulation</em>: Tidyverse and tm(text mining)</li>
<li><em>Visualizations</em>: ggplot2</li>
<li><em>Machine Learning</em>: caret</li>
</ul>
<p><em>RStudio</em> as IDE</p>
<p><br />
RESULTS</p>
<p>There are two Machine Learning parts in this challenge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supervised ML: predicting the number of starts a user will give based on the content of his review. Results on test (75%/25% split):
<ul>
<li>Accuracy: 84%</li>
<li>Kappa: 0.63</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Unsupervised ML. Use of clustering techniques like K-Means and Hierarchical clustering to find different types of groups in the prices of Smartphones. Here I can not show you metrics, as we do not have any target variable, but the results I achieved are very similar to the manual splits I did it. It shows it is a good way to find groups of products based on price.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
CONCLUSIONS</p>
<p>Both tasks, sentiment analysis, and clustering have been accomplished successfully. This dataset can help us to create models to implement them in other E-Commerce platforms and optimize their clients’ analysis.</p>
