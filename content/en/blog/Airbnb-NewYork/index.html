<p>OVERVIEW</p>
<p>The main goal is to understand though visualizations how the prices for Airbnb in New York are distributed. To achieve that, we will use a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data">kaggle dataset provided by Airbnb</a>. First, we will look at the whole city, and then we will analyze each neighborhood.</p>
<p>The following map shows us the price distribution in the city of New York.</p>

<p>There is a big amount of options with high prices in the area of Manhattan.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s go in deep about the number of observations and the median price for each neighbourhood:</p>
