I am a data enthusiast, with experience in sales and marketing. 

While I was learning more about data, I discovered R, and I felt in love. 
Since then, I have been mastering my skills in all Tidyverse packages and improving my analytical abilities. 

This website aims to be a place to post my projects and my thoughts about how data is changing the world.
